                                Learning Dutch:  I do this by reading books, watching TV, and writing.  
                                I also try to speak Dutch whenever possible
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Programming:  I've been learning Haskell and Rust.
                                Haskell is interesting to me as it's a purely functional programming language and 
                                Rust interests me as language used mostly for systems programming but with memory safety.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Gaming:  At the moment I'm playing Metroid Prime.  
                                The one originally made for GameCube but I have the Switch HD remake.  
                                I played it as a kid and I enjoy the nostalgic feeling of playing it again.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className="Left-padding">
                            Otherwise I spend my free time however I want to.  
                            This includes spending time with my wife, cat, and friends, exercising, reading,
                            watching Netflix, and anything else that I decide I want to do.
