                                I also try to speak Dutch whenever possible but with the current
                                covid situation this is difficult

                                Programming:  I'm focusing on ReactJS and NodeJS.
                                I enjoy working with both of these technologies and really like the 
                                features that ES6 has offered.  Normally I use TypeScript as well.

                                Gaming:  I have both a Nintendo Switch and an Oculus Quest 2.
                                On the Nintendo Switch I've mostly been playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate with my wife
                                and on the Quest 2 I've been playing In Death: Unchained.

                            Otherwise I spend my free time however I want to.

                            watching Netflix, and anything else that I decide I want to do.
