                                Learning Dutch:  I do this by reading books, watching TV, and writing.  
                                I also try to speak Dutch whenever possible
                            </li>

                                Programming:  I've been reading The Pragmattic Programmer which I would recommend.
                                Afterwards I plan to look into SQL a bit more deeply.
                            </li>

                                Gaming:  At the moment I'm playing Red Dead Redemption, the first one.  
                                I never played either Red Dead Redemptions when they first came out but this 
                                one is quite fun and makes me excited for the second.  I'm also looking forward 
                                to "The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom" as I'm a big Legend of Zelda fan.
                            </li>

                            Otherwise I spend my free time however I want to.  
                            This includes spending time with my wife, cat, and friends, exercising, reading,
                            watching TV, and anything else that I decide I want to do.
